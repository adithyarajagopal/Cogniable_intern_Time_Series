# Cogniable_intern_Time_Series
This is a part of my internship at Cogniable, a healthcare AI startup
My task was to buid a time series model to predict the programs to be allocated to patients so that they recover from autism in the fastest possible way

The target code column which you would see in my code is like a code for each program to be allocated to a child, it can be to improve specific attriburtes like communication, understanding humour, sarcasm, attention span etc
